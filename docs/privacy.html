  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated"><strong>LoopJournal</strong> — Last updated: [INSERT DATE e.g. February 2025]</p>

  <p>This privacy policy describes how the iOS app <strong>LoopJournal</strong> ("we", "the app") handles information when you use the app. It reflects behavior that has been verified in the app's codebase; we do not describe practices that are not present or verifiable there.</p>

  <h2>1. Data collection</h2>
  <p><strong>What we collect:</strong> The only data the app collects is the content you create inside the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Journal entries (text, date, and mood selections)</li>
    <li>Photos you attach to entries (stored only on your device)</li>
    <li>Voice recordings you create in the app</li>
    <li>Links you add to entries</li>
    <li>App settings (e.g. preferences, optional app lock)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What we do not collect:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your name, email, or any account identifier. The app does not require an account.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect device identifiers for advertising or tracking.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect analytics, crash reports, or usage data.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for tracking across apps or websites.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How we use your data</h2>
  <p>Your data is used only to provide the app's features: to display your entries, store them on your device, let you edit or delete them, and (if you turn on the option) to save a copy of attached photos to your device's Photo Library. We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose other than running the app on your device.</p>

  <h2>3. Where your data is stored</h2>
  <p><strong>All journal data is stored only on your device.</strong> We do not send your entries, photos, voice recordings, or settings to our servers or any third party. There is no cloud sync, no backup to our systems, and no transmission of your journal content off your device.</p>
  <p>If you enable "Save photos to device" in settings, the app may save a copy of photos you attach to entries into your device's Photo Library. That copy is subject to your device and Apple's policies, not transmitted to us.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</strong> The app uses only Apple's built-in frameworks (e.g. for storage, photos, microphone, and security). No third-party SDKs are used to collect or process your data.</p>

  <h2>5. Tracking and advertising</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not track you.</strong> The app does not use the Advertising Identifier (IDFA), does not request App Tracking Transparency (ATT), and does not link your data with tracking across apps or websites. Our app's privacy manifest declares that we do not track users.</p>

  <h2>6. Your rights (access and deletion)</h2>
  <p><strong>Access:</strong> Because all data stays on your device, you can access everything you've created directly in the app.</p>
  <p><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete a single entry (trash icon on the entry) or delete all of your journal data at once in Settings under "Delete All Data." Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. The app does not send your data to any server; we have no servers that store your journal content, so we do not retain copies once you delete data in the app.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>LoopJournal is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided data in the app, you can delete that data using the in-app "Delete All Data" option in Settings.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>In the codebase, the app is configured with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple data protection (file protection) for the app's stored data, as set in the app's entitlements.</li>
    <li>An optional app lock (Face ID or Touch ID) that you can enable in Settings. The app uses the system's LocalAuthentication API for unlock only; no biometric data is stored or transmitted by the app (verified in code).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The app does not transmit your journal content over the internet (no network transmission of journal data is present in the codebase).</p>

  <h2>9. Permissions we request</h2>
  <p>The app may ask for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photo Library (read):</strong> To let you attach photos from your library to journal entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Photo Library (add only):</strong> Only if you turn on "Save photos to device," to save a copy of attached photos to your library.</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> To record voice notes for entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Face ID / Touch ID:</strong> Only if you enable app lock, to unlock the app. We do not collect or store biometric data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not request location, camera, contacts, or other permissions beyond what is listed above.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will post the current version at this URL (or in the app) and will note the last updated date. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the updated policy. If we make material changes that affect how we handle your data, we will bring them to your attention (e.g. in the app or via this page).</p>

  <h2>11. Contact</h2>
  <p>For privacy-related questions or requests, contact us at:</p>
  <p><strong>[INSERT CONTACT EMAIL e.g. privacy@loopjournal.app or support@loopjournal.app]</strong></p>
  <p>If you are in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or Canada, you may have additional rights under local law (e.g. access, correction, deletion, or complaint to a supervisory authority). You can exercise deletion using the in-app options above and contact us for other requests.</p>
